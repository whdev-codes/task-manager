## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

### 🔹 Frontend:
- HTML, CSS
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript
- Toasts & loading animations

### 🔹 Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB Atlas
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing

---

🛠️ Note:
The backend is hosted on Render’s free tier, which may cause an initial delay (up to 50 seconds) when the server spins up after inactivity. During this time, a loading animation will be visible on the UI while the request completes. Subsequent actions will be faster once the backend is active.
